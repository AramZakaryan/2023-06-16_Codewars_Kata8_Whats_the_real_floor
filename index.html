        // DESCRIPTION:

        // Americans are odd people: in their buildings, the first floor is actually the ground floor and 
        // there is no 13th floor (due to superstition).

        // Write a function that given a floor in the american system returns the floor in the european system.

        // With the 1st floor being replaced by the ground floor and the 13th floor being removed, 
        // the numbers move down to take their place. 
        // In case of above 13, they move down by two because there are two omitted numbers below them.

        // Basements (negatives) stay the same as the universal level.

        // More information here

        // Examples

        // 1  =>  0 
        // 0  =>  0
        // 5  =>  4
        // 15  =>  13
        // -3  =>  -3

        // My version

        const getRealFloor = n =>
            n > 13 ? n - 2 :
                n > 0 ? n - 1 : n;


        console.log(getRealFloor(1));
        console.log(getRealFloor(0));
        console.log(getRealFloor(5));
        console.log(getRealFloor(15));
        console.log(getRealFloor(-3));


        // Very interesting version

        const getRealFloor1 = n => n - (n > 12) - (n > 0) // That means: 5 - ture = 4


        console.log(getRealFloor1(1));
        console.log(getRealFloor1(0));
        console.log(getRealFloor1(5));
        console.log(getRealFloor1(15));
        console.log(getRealFloor1(-3));
